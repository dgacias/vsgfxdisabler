Vampire Survivors Graphical Effects disabler

This powershell script will allow you to disable individual effects of your liking to be able to see more screen and also gain more FPS due to less artifacts being drawn. You can restore the original files within the application.

INSTALLATION
Download vsgfxdisabler.ps1 and place it in your "img" directory. In my case the path is [Vampire survivors installation dir]\resources\app\.webpack\renderer\assets\img\

Right click on the powershell file and "Run with powershell". Wait some seconds for the program to load and you can start disabling the effects you do not want to see on screen.

Remember to save the changes!

If you restore any original files, close and open the program again to refresh the changes.
