Vampire Survivors Graphical Effects disabler

This powershell script will allow you to disable individual effects of your liking to be able to see more screen and also gain more FPS due to less artifacts being drawn. You can restore the original files within the application.

## INSTALLATION
Download vsgfxdisabler.ps1 and place it in your "img" directory. In my case the path is [Vampire survivors installation dir]\resources\app\.webpack\renderer\assets\img\
It should be the directory that contains the items.json, items.png, vfx.json and vfx.png files.


Right click on the powershell file and select "Run with powershell". Wait some seconds for the program to load all the images from the game and you can start disabling the effects you do not want to see on screen.

Remember to save the changes! (It may take some seconds, wait until a popup is displayed)

NOTE: Reenabling the checkboxes actually do nothing even if you save at this moment, please restore the original file and disable again the effects you do not want to see.
If you restore any original files, close and open the program again to refresh the changes.
